USER STORY (5 points):
As a developer, I want to document (text file, canvas comment, etc.) where I am using dependency injection and what benefits it 
adds to the structure of my application.

Answer:
I am using dependency injection in the MartketingForm class. To create a new MarketingFirm, anything that utlizes the
ISweepstakesManager interface can be sent into the MarketingFirm class to create it.
